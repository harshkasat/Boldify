## Boldify: README.md

**1. Project Title and Short Description**

Boldify - Convert text to bold Unicode characters.

A simple web application that converts regular text into bold Unicode characters, suitable for use in applications like Gmail where standard bold formatting might not be supported in subject lines.


**2. Project Overview**

Boldify provides a quick and easy way to style text using bold Unicode characters.  This is particularly useful in environments that don't natively support rich text formatting, such as certain email clients (like Gmail subject lines).  The application takes input text, converts each character to its bold Unicode equivalent (if available), and displays the result.  A copy button allows users to easily copy the converted text to their clipboard.
